## Final Project

It's time to take your knowledge of the React API and build a few applications! First, go through the tutorial [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) to build a small Tic Tac Toe game.

Next, try to build a browser based game using Components! Here are some ideas:

- Hangman
- Snake
- Minesweeper
- Jeopardy
- Card games (Blackjack, Poker, etc)
- Dice games (Craps, Yahtzee, etc)
- Memory game
- Mad Libs
