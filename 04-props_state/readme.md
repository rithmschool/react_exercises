## Props + State Exercises

## Part 1

Create two components, `TodoList` and `Todo`. The `TodoList` component should contain an array called `todos`. The `TodoList` component should be responsible for listing all of the Todos, which should each display the task necessary to complete. 

You have full control of what you would like the UI of this application to be, but think carefully about the components you will need as well as the props and state. Make sure you are using webpack and ES2015 classes when building your components and application.
