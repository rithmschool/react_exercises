## State Exercises

For this exercise, you will create 24 components (square shaped divs) that have a specific background color. Each time you click on one of the divs, it cycles to the next background color.

*BONUS* - Make the background color changing random, i.e. when I click a color, it selects randomly from the list of colors.

Your application should look like this:
